Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a graduate Software Engineer from Fullstack Academy. I have built web applications with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) and PERN (PostgreSql, Express, React, NodeJS) stack.

âš¡ Fun fact: I love martial arts and anything outdoors! My favorite places to visit is Hawaii and Thailand!
