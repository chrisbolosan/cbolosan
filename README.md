🙌🏼 𝗠𝗜𝗦𝗦𝗜𝗢𝗡 & 𝗩𝗜𝗦𝗜𝗢𝗡

 I love being part of a company where I can not only help the overall business, but also allows me to grow my skills and experience as well. Coding was always something I wanted to make happen prior to FullStack and through my progressive continual growth began to fall more in love with the fact that I can be creative and create applications that reach out to people. I look forward to exploring different avenues of full stack roles where I can be part of a company that provides mentorship, and allows me to create products that net’s a positive impact in the industry.
